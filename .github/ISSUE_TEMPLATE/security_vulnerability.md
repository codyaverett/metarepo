## Security Vulnerability Reporting

**IMPORTANT:** Please do not report security vulnerabilities in public issues!

For security vulnerabilities, please follow the process outlined in [SECURITY.md](../../SECURITY.md):

1. **Email:** Send details to the security contact listed in SECURITY.md
2. **GitHub Security Advisory:** Use GitHub's private security reporting feature
3. **Provide details:**
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

If this is NOT a security vulnerability but a regular bug, please close this issue and use the **Bug Report** template instead.

For questions about security practices or general security concerns (not specific vulnerabilities), you may use this template, but please clearly state it's not a vulnerability report.
